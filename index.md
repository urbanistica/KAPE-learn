# RESOURCES

Our project is focused on developing and repurposing instructional material related to the two primary software tools that we're focusing on. Unreal Engine is the basis for Game Development per se. Blender is the opensource, free 3D Swiss Army Knife for modelling and animation.

These are the remarkable, industry-standard tools that our students will use to develop an understanding, as well as creative and technical potential: their own, and the software. 

## BACKGROUND

In December, 2022, KAPE (Kampuchea Action to Promote Education) began working with Apptessence, to explore a new direction in STEM education. As the leader in progressive education and pedagogy in Cambodia, KAPE is ideally suited to promote this initiative. Our program is now under development, and will be deployed in the New Generation School [NGS] system in 2023.

Watch this space for updates to our project, new curriculum units, and resources as they are developed.
