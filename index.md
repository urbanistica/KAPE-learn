# WELCOME TO THE APSARA GAME DEV INITIATIVE

Our goal is to open a door to opportunity in the world of game development, for high school learners. We're especially focused on education in emerging economies, and our origins are in the KAPE Game Dev Iniative, created in Cambodia's NGS [New Generation Schools] public school system.

Our program is designed to fit comfortably into STEM programs, and to complement the coding initiatives that are a customary part of the "T" in STEM. Our project was developed by Apptessence Education and Technology, a Canadian tech education consulting firm with experience innovating in the area of learning experiences. Our program incorporates many lessons learned from 25 years of building and deploying intensive tech education courses, bootcamps, mentoring, and curriculum development.

## WHO CAN USE THE COURSE, AND HOW IS IT DEPLOYED?

Our course was originally built as a part of the regular, state-approved secondary education system. In general, it assumes a high-schooler's knowledge of underlying concepts familiar from geometry. 

It was designed to fit into a regular schedule, as a 4-hour per week class. But we've also worked with it in more intensive, 12 hour-a-week configuration, and it can be delivered in an intensive, 3 week bootcamp configuration as well. The total number of hours for the course in its full form is about 128.

It's designed to be taken with a minimum of 6 students, and can also be taught in units of 12 or 18 students, with each unit of 6 being essentially a replication of the basic 6. Pairs of students are constanly broken up and re-paired as part of our teaching strategies.

## ADOPTING THE COURSE

Schools that adopt the course get a full support package to allow them to smoothly incorporate the course into their programs. That includes up to 70 hours of consultation that comprises teacher training, technical assistance, classroom design, and help in adapting things like exiting systems. 

The course is delivered via a Learning Management System that is delivered on the internet. In cases where internet availability is uneven, course units can be downloaded, along with the resources that the use. We don't recommend this approach, but if circumstances require it, we can work to provide you with a standalone version of the course that can be delivered when unconnected.

The course should be taught in a dedicated space, or resource center. This can be in a separate classroom, or as a resource centre that is part of a library or similar facility. We can also provide access to our labs in downtown Phnom Penh for schools whose students are able to travel. The total outlay of space required is under 50sq m. for up to 18 students (12 recommended).

The course is billed on a flat per-year basis, with significant discounts for multi-year contracts. The school can teach the course to as many as 36 students per year, without incurring extra charges.

# RESOURCES

Our project is focused on developing and repurposing instructional material related to the two primary software tools that we're focusing on. Unreal Engine is the basis for Game Development per se. Blender is the opensource, free 3D Swiss Army Knife for modelling and animation.

Our students will develop their creative and technical potential through these remarkable, industry-standard tools. 

## BACKGROUND

In December, 2022, KAPE (Kampuchea Action to Promote Education) began working with Apptessence, to explore a new direction in STEM education. As the leader in progressive education and pedagogy in Cambodia, KAPE is ideally suited to promote this initiative. Our program is now under development, and will be deployed in the New Generation School [NGS] system in 2023.

Watch this space for any updates to our project, new curriculum units, and resources as they are developed.
