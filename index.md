# WELCOME TO THE APPTESSENCE GAME DEV INITIATIVE

<img src="/KAPE-learn/assets/images/class1.jpg" />

<span class="hilite">The best doorway to learning is the one that a student is already knocking on. </span> Our goal is to open a door for high school students to the technologies and opportunities in <a href="#whyGames">modern 3D game development skills.</a>

Not every student is ready to embrace technology in its usual STEM forms, such as coding and robotics. But every student has a phone with games they’ve downloaded or play online. Students’ passion for games is a fact: we introduce technology used in the global half-trillion dollar game industry to students through our unique, resource-rich curriculum in Game Asset Development. 

By doing this, <span class="hilite">students get a foothold on the path to mastery of game tech in a meaningful, creative, technically challenging way.</span> Students – including ones who might not explore technology in traditional STEM formats – have an entry point to a tech sector they already care about. 

Our program is designed to fit comfortably into STEM programs, and to complement the coding initiatives that are a customary part of the "T" in STEM. Our project was developed by Apptessence Education and Technology, a Canadian tech education consulting firm with experience innovating in the area of learning experiences. Our program incorporates many lessons learned from 25 years of building and deploying intensive tech education courses, bootcamps, mentoring, and curriculum development.

## WHO CAN USE THE COURSE, AND HOW IS IT DEPLOYED?

Our course was originally built to integrate into STEM programs offered at public schools in Cambodia. In Cambodia, as in many other places, many students would never get the chance to access the more powerful or specialized technology that Game Development uses. By creating a fully integrated course, curriculum and technical fit-out, to work in an emerging economy context, <span class="hilite">we've opened up exciting new possibilities to schools</span>, including those under  budget constraints.

We do this by offering the course through resource centres that are located offsite, that students can access. We already have the first such centre operating in downtown Phnom Penh, and we are working with schools and school groups to create new locations to maximize access and convenience.

<span class="hilite">It was designed to fit flexibly into regular class schedules</span>, and part of the integrated service is to work to adapt our class schedules to harmonize with yours. It can be offered at a once-a-week block of minimum 3 hours; as a weekend or after-school class, and the roughly 100 hours can be offered on accelerated on up to 35 week two term basis.

Twelve or eighteen students take the course together, and we can work with schools who have course enrolments of as few as 2 students, by grouping students from multiple schools in a single course.

## ADOPTING THE COURSE

For schools in downtown Phnom Penh, you can start right away. <span class="hilite">Our resource lab is already fully operational at our location at Sisowath High School.</span> There, a modern, equipped learning environment is waiting for your students to start, with specifically trained, experienced teachers leading the class.

This option is inexpensive, convenient and entails no special preparation or costs. 

For most schools in the Sisowath catchment area, this is the best option. For those schools, or groups of schools interested in a resource centre in their area, or in some cases, in installing a learning centre in their own facility, contact us to explore options. <span class="hilite">We can provide full assistance at every step of the process, including classroom design, technology, curriculum customization, and teacher training</span>.

Whether your students attend our Sisowath facility, or another one, they learn from the same standard curriculum. This curriculum is continously updated as we find ways to improve, restructure and develpe more and richer resource materials to enhance the learning experience. It's delivered via a Learning Management System that can be customized to your needs and grading approaches, and is fully cloud-based, with nothing to install.

<!--
Schools that adopt the course get a full support package to allow them to smoothly incorporate the course into their programs. That includes up to 70 hours of consultation that comprises teacher training, technical assistance, classroom design, and help in adapting things like existing workstations or systems. The course and course materials are continuously updated, so users get the latest curriculum at all times.-->

<!-- The course is delivered via a Learning Management System that is delivered on the internet, with nothing needed to be installed. In cases where internet availability is uneven, course units can be downloaded, along with the resources that they use. We don't recommend this approach, but if circumstances require it, we can work to provide you with a standalone version of the course that can be delivered when unconnected. -->



<!-- The course is taught in a dedicated space. This can be in a separate classroom, or as a resource centre that is part of a library or similar facility. We can also provide access to our labs in downtown Phnom Penh for schools whose students are able to travel. The total outlay of space required is under 50sq m. for up to 18 students (12 recommended). -->

<!-- The course is billed on a flat per-year basis, with significant discounts for multi-year contracts. The school can teach the course to as many as 36 students per year, without incurring extra charges. -->

<!-- ## RESOURCES AND SOFTWARE -->

<!-- The course is based on two industry-standard software packages. Both are free, so cash-strapped schools won't have to sign on to expensive software that can push technology out of reach. Both are widely used in the game development sector. One is Blender, a free, open-source application that provides a vast range of capabilities, allowing students to explore many aspects of 3D design, animation, character development, environment creation, and many many other things. Unreal Engine is the global leader among Game Engines – these are the immensely powerful packages that the vast majority of game developers use to build their games. Unreal's creator, Epic Games, allows free use of their software.  -->


<!-- 
Our project is focused on developing and repurposing instructional material related to the two primary software tools that we're focusing on. Unreal Engine is the basis for Game Development per se. Blender is the opensource, free 3D Swiss Army Knife for modelling and animation. -->

<!-- Our students will develop their creative and technical potential through these remarkable, industry-standard tools.  --> 

## BACKGROUND

In December, 2022, KAPE (Kampuchea Action to Promote Education) began working with Apptessence, to explore a new direction in STEM education. As the leader in progressive education and pedagogy in Cambodia, KAPE is ideally suited to promote this initiative. We continue to work closely with KAPE to develop access to the course as a public good, via the New Generation Schools [NGS] system that KAPE runs on behalf of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport.
